# Datapack-PVPText

A Minecraft Java datapack that displays some simple "hints."

-------------------------------------------------------------
> The code of this datapack is **a complete mess**...

This datapack adds some PVP-related hints or feedback, such as:
- Modified messages for killing players or player deaths (though the original death messages are removed...)
- Players will switch to spectator mode upon death and are forced to spectate other players (version 1.3 and above)
- Displays kill count, death count, and the number of remaining players in the arena: [75/100]

Minecraft Java datapack development is really niche... If there are enthusiasts who'd like to collaborate..., thank you!
