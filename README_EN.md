# Datapack-PVPText
A Minecraft Java datapack that can display some simple "hints"

-------------------------------------------------------------
> This datapack function and its **mess**......

- This datapack adds some PVP-related hints or feedback, such as:
- Changed the hints for killing a player or player death (but the original death hint is gone...ing...)
- After a player dies, they will become spectator mode and force spectator players ~~(version 1.3 and above)~~ (wrong, it's 1.1)
- Display kills, deaths, and remaining players in the field: [75/100]
- Minecraft Java datapack development is really niche... if there are enthusiasts working together... thank you!
